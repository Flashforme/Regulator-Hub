Mass repository for MA2/3 software code/fixes/Workarounds etc.

//When updating/uploading//
  // Comment your commitments, so others can follow the progress! //
  // Single XML pools (Multiple Macro's) either name them as their creator for a batch or as the single macro's name //
  // For packages ((Macro's or LUA containing multiple dependencies)) Package them in a ZIP or RAR file, with a README file to describe the process of initializing for first time use
      / I.E. Two macro's working as an on or off, depends on a unique IP address, multiple users + userprofiles, creation of pool objects (Worlds for instance) /
      / If package has a LUA which creates said system within MA, note that in the README for easier use /
